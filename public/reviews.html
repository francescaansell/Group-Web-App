      <h4>Great place to start! &starf; &starf; &starf; &starf; &starf;</h4> 
      <p> I had a super easy time getting started with therapy here. I attened private therapy sessions with Dr. Julie. 
        She was super receptive to my needs and made me feel very confortable. This was my first therapy expereince and I would say it was a good one. </p>

      <div id="rFlex3">
        <h4>Great alternative to inperson  &starf; &starf; &starf; &starf; &starf;</h4>
        <p> During this pandemic I had issues trying to find therapist that where accepting new paitents. It makes it even harder that no one can be seen in person. This was a great option for me so that I could continue to attend therapy during isloation. </p>
