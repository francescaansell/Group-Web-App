      <h4>Great place to start! &starf; &starf; &starf; &starf; &starf;</h4> 
      <p> I had a super easy time getting started with therapy here. I attened private therapy sessions with Dr. Julie. 
        She was super receptive to my needs and made me feel very confortable. This was my first therapy expereince and I would say it was a good one. </p>
