Resubmission for Sprint 2:

In sprint two, we received a point off for our reviews page as there were some invalid characters that made the file malformed.
These characters came from Elissa's notes app as she wrote the code there and sent it to Frankie to add to the file because
her branch had been messed up and she needed to consult Dr.Haynes the next day in order to figure out how to fix it. It seems
as if the quotation marks were causing the issue, so we made sure 

In order to fix the reviews page, we removed the code that contained the review/rating submission form from the reviews.html
and reviews.js files and completely rewrote them. It seems as if the quotation marks were causing the issue, so we made sure 
to re-write the code incase any other special characters would show up as invalid as well. This ensured that the text would 
be correct and understood and that the submission form worked properly.
