                  Group Sessions are intended to be safe and collaborative environments for you and others to interact
                  and talk about issues. Usually, these sessions are for lighter topics and help individuals manage stress.
                  Attendees often find peace and security in sharing strategies that they use to improve their well-being.

                Private sessions are intended to be more personal, occuring between just you and your therapist.
                During these sessions, you'll spend time with your therapist to indentify key points 
                that may be causing disruption in your life. These consultation sessions are designed to
                allow you to set up sessions based on your needs, allowing you to schedule at your convenience. </br> </br>
                Couples therapy and family therapy will also occur in this category, as you and your family/partner will attend together.

                In extreme cases, you can schedule emergency sessions to receive immediate
                consultation from one of our therapists. In the event that they aren not available
                to assist you during this time, we will work with you to schedule an immediate
                appointment with another therapist to ensure that you get the help you need.
