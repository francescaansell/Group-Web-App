                Private sessions are intended to be more personal sessions between you and a therapist.
                During these sessions, you'll spend time with your therapist to indentify key points 
                that may be causing disruption in your life. These consultation sessions are designed to

                In extreme cases, you can schedule emergency sessions to receive immediate

                to assist you during this time we will work with you to schedule an immediate
                appointment with another therapist to ensure you get the help you need.
